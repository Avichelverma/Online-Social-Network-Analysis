A gist of analysis:
==================
1. As a part of this assignment, I have collected raw twitter data, tweets and clustered people into groups.
2. I also found the number of communities formed.
3. I was able to prune the graph to remove the outliers (nodes with MinDegree).
4. I was able to analyze TextBlob, Afinn dict for sentiment classification (Sentiment analysis of a given tweet).
5. Furthermore, I had data which was labelled through AFINN dict, hence I made use of the data for building the prediction model, and then splitting them into 70% of Training data and 30% testing data.
6. Vectorized the training and testing data, fitted the Logistic regression on this training data.
7. Predicted the Sentiment analysis for the testing data.
8. Find the accuracies.
